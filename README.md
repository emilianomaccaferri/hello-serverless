# hello-serverless
boilerplate for a typescript-based aws lambda app

# what
AWS has TERRIBLE documentation but, fortunately, the folks at [Serverless](https://serverless.com) have created this fantastic tool that helps with all the pain and chaos Amazon has brought onto all of us. You know what else has terrible documentation? (A lot of) JavaScript packages.<br>
I created this repo as a result of 2-3 days of hopeless google searches trying to create a starting point (the infamous todo app) for building serverless apps, so here you go.
<br>Hope this can be of use.
# why
A client of mine wanted a serverless app deployed on lambda and I figured this was the right occasion to create this repo.
# how
* [Install Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started)
* `git clone https://github.com/emilianomaccaferri/hello-serverless`
* `cd hello-serverless`
* `npm install`
* Enjoy
